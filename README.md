"# carraceapp" 
Create a race care setup selector. The purpose of the program is to rank a given set of car configurations for a particular, given, race track, based on the full race completion time.
-          The 2 main entities are: Race Track and Car Configuration

-          The race track has the following properties:

o   Lap distance

o   Number of laps to complete

o   Time it takes to make a pitstop

-          “Known” properties of each car configuration, for a particular race track are:

o   Fuel capacity

o   Time to complete a lap

o   Average fuel consumption per lap

-          Assumptions:

o   Car if fuelled to its configuration at the start of the race

o   Car is fuelled up to the same level each pitstop

o   Pitstop times are static

<<<<<<< HEAD
o   Lap times are consistent
