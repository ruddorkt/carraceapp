Code Challenge
Create a race care setup selector. The purpose of the program is to rank a given set of car configurations for a particular, given, race track, based on the full race completion time.
          The 2 main entities are: Race Track and Car Configuration

          The race track has the following properties:

   Lap distance

   Number of laps to complete

   Time it takes to make a pitstop

          “Known” properties of each car configuration, for a particular race track are:

   Fuel capacity

   Time to complete a lap

   Average fuel consumption per lap

          Assumptions:

   Car if fuelled to its configuration at the start of the race

   Car is fuelled up to the same level each pitstop

   Pitstop times are static
